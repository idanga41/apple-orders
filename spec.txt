📝 Project Specification: Apple Orders Flask App

🎯 Purpose:
A Flask-based web API for viewing Apple products, placing orders, and managing stock in real time via simple HTTP requests.

📌 Core Functionality:

1. Home Page (GET /)
- Returns a welcome message: "Welcome to Apple Orders API"

2. Product List (GET /products)
- Returns a list of available Apple products in JSON format.
- Each product includes:
  - id: unique identifier
  - name: product name
  - stock: available quantity

3. Place an Order (POST /order)
- Accepts a JSON payload with:
  - product_id: the ID of the product to order
  - customer_name: name of the customer placing the order

- Logic:
  - If the product exists and stock > 0:
    → Returns a success message and decreases stock by 1
  - If the product does not exist:
    → Returns error: "Product not found"
  - If stock is 0:
    → Returns error: "Product is out of stock"

(Optional) 4. View Orders (GET /orders)
- Returns a list of all orders that have been placed (if implemented)

🛠️ Data Handling:
- Product list and stock are stored in memory (no database).
- Orders are also stored in memory (if implemented).
